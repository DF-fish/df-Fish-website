# df-Fish-website
Django Weblog -- introductory data science

To get this code running on your windows machine:

1. Download Django
2. Create a directory for your project files
3. Start up the command line as administrator
4. Navigate to the project folder on command line and run python -m venv data-fish-env to create your virtual environment
(data-fish-env is what I named it, but you can name it whatever you like)
5. Activate the VE by navigating to data-fish-env and running scripts\activate
6. Navigate back to your project folder, and run git clone https://github.com/DF-fish/df-Fish-website
7. Run the command: pip install -r requirments.txt to install all of the requirements for this project into the virtual environment.
8. Now you should now be able to run your project from the folder by using that manage.py scripts.  The command to run it is: python manage.py runserver.  When you open a browser at localhost:8000 you should be able to see that site running in the development environment :)
